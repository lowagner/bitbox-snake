arcade.c:  standard deathmatch play
    bugs:
        sometimes two of the options stay up even after a screen reset.  rare!
        wouldn't reboot in solo mode after killing off player zero... perhaps fixed!

    new stuff:
        * need global score
        * need new mode:  coop (in addition to solo and duel)
        * press A to get to level play.
        * allow L/R to be left/right turn commands for snake movement.

    game-of-life easter egg:  use a background callback to make food spawn and die.


    change memset to a standard uint32_t *fill type thing, so we can use bg_color
    without it being zero.

    game mode tweaks:
        starvation:  if you don't eat, you get smaller, until you die.
        ammo-is-length:  you can fire only based on your length, and one bullet requires one unit length.

creator.c:
    put all snake levels in a FAT directory called snakelvl

    need a command overlay for various commands:
        save: yes/no/as
        color: f-f-f -> max options.
            (recall that you can't save the smallest bit of color yourself,
             since that is used for encoding purposes.)
        save as:  8 letters available.  (then auto .ppm)

    timer == 0: play game

    timer < 10: countdown to play game

    timer==255 [main menu]:
        Y, start -> play the level, Y with countdown, start without.
        B, select -> opens up level editor (timer==253) with restart_after_timer=1 for B and 0 for select
        X -> save as (timer==254)
        L/R, dpad left/right - switch level
        A switch to arcade mode

        in timer==255, we should always have restart_after_timer = 1, 
        since the menu is always shown in this pause state.
    
    timer==254 [save as menu]
        internally:  before we go to save-as, we create a tmp file.
        saving copies the tmp file to another file.
        the save-as screen shows us 8 characters we get to choose to determine the filename.

        controls:
            left/right - choose letter to modify
            up/down - scroll through alphabet

            Y/A - next/previous vowel, or 'u'/'e' if the letter is not already a vowel.
                e a o i u y
            B/X - next/previous popular consonant, or 't'/'d' if the letter is not already a consonant
                t n s r h l d c m w f g p b v k x j q z y


        make sure the filename chosen does not conflict with the tmp filename we use.
        or perhaps use something like tmplevel.tmp which uses a different file extension.

    timer==253 [level editor]:

        if restart_after_timer == 1:  # menu is being shown:
            start -> if file is not saved, prompts to save as, with filename as default, then moves to main menu.
                if file is saved, move to main pause menu (timer=255, restart_after_timer=1) with the current level.
            select -> saves
                if there is a tmp file, it deletes that.
            L/R - snake size
            dpad-up/down - change speed of snake
            B - changes gun possibilities
            dpad-right/left - switch win conditions
            X - modifies win conditions

            A - switch to arcade mode, but check for file unsavedness

        else: # menu is not being shown:
            dpad - move cursor around

            Y - paint square at cursor with selected color, 
                or if marker is set, paint line from marker to the cursor (see L-hold).
            X - open color select (timer == 252)
            B - switch to previous color (back).  editor starts with white and black as current/prev colors
            A - switch to color currently under cursor

            L-hold - put down a marker at the cursor's current spot.
           
            R - remove color at cursor's square (or if there's a marker set, erase a line)

            start - show menu (restart_after_timer = 1)
            R+start - play level - be careful there's nothing directly under your cursor...

            select - save
    
    timer==252 pause controls [color select]:
        
        here always restart_after_timer = 1.
       
        dpad-left/right - select R, G, or B 
        dpad-up/down - modify current primary color's level
        Y - white
        B - black
        X - random
        A - choose a player color.  if already on a player color, switch to the next one.

        start/select - choose this color and exit pause control.  
            (reload level, set timer==253, restart = 0)
        


    player start locations are given on the map via a spot with the player color, 
    with the heading/direction encoded in.
        on the preview map:
            blinking yellow block in the direction the player heads out.  that spot must be free.

    maybe something for later:  cannons:
        shoot special bullets which are taken care of in the background callback
        can either shoot food or fire.

level.c:
    level type:
        solo or coop -- coop has a second player location (obviously)

    win conditions:
        survival, eat enough food, or both.

        in survival, you need to survive until all your tail comes out.

        in eat enough food, you need to eat some specified amount of food.

        when both are on, you have to meet both goals... obviously...
